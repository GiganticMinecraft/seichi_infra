Chairs:

  # Enabling this makes BetterChairs use Arrows instead of ArmorStands.
  # ArmorStands are made invisible so the player doesn't see anything of the magic happening when sitting.
  # But Spigot can be very unreliable on some versions (e.g. players instantly stopping to sit)
  #
  # If you are experiencing issues with ArmorStands, enable this option.
