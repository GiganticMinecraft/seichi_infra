# Whether to immediately save all shopkeeper data whenever a shopkeeper is

# If you have a large server with many players and/or many shopkeepers, it
# might be a good idea to disable this for performance reasons.
save-instantly: true

# Enables the automatic conversion of items inside the inventories of players
# and shop containers whenever a player opens a shopkeeper UI (e.g. trading,
# editor, hiring, etc.) The items are converted to conform to Spigot's internal
# data format.
# This setting helps with issues related to items that have been created on
# previous Spigot versions or via some Minecraft mechanism (e.g. give command,
# loot tables, etc.) no longer getting accepted when trading with shopkeepers.
# In order for the items to get reliably accepted during trades, their data has
# to match the internal format that Spigot uses when a plugin would create the
# same items via the Spigot API. Spigot occasionally makes changes to this
# internal data format. Any previously created items, or newly created items
# that don't conform to this new format, may cause trading and item stacking
# issues then.
# This setting is intended to help with the portion of the issue affecting
# shopkeeper trades. This setting will not reliably help you prevent item
# stacking related issues!
# Enabling this setting comes with a performance impact! Try to avoid using
# this option and search for alternative solutions instead (e.g. stick to
# Spigot's data format when creating items via Minecraft mechanisms). Try to
# only keep this setting enabled for as long as required (e.g. until you assume
# that most of your players' legacy items got converted by now).
convert-player-items: false

# *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*
# Plugin Compatibility
# *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*

# During start-up, the plugin performs some basic checks to verify that certain
# aspects of the server implementation work as expected. For example, one of
# the tested aspects is that the comparison of item stacks works correctly,
# which is quite essential for an item-based trading plugin such as
# Shopkeepers. If any of these tests fail, the plugin disables itself to avoid
# problems that can otherwise arise later.
# However, even if one of this tests fails, the plugin might still be usable to
# some degree. For example, an issue with the item stack comparisons might only
# affect specific kinds of item stacks.
# If you want to take the risk and try running the plugin anyway, even though a
# potential problem has been detected, you can enable this setting. However, do
# not expect any support when you subsequently encounter problems while this
# setting is enabled, or has been enabled in the past.

# If enabled, players will only be able to place shopkeepers where they have

enable-world-guard-restrictions: false
# If enabled (additionally to the enable-world-guard-restrictions setting),
# players will only be able to place shopkeepers in regions where the
# 'allow-shop' flag is set, but nowhere else. However, players will still
# require container access to set up shops. And in case they can't place
# containers in the affected region, shop containers need to be pre-setup by
# someone else and the require-container-recently-placed setting needs to be
# disabled.
require-world-guard-allow-shop-flag: false

# In order to guard against unnoticed changes to a player's currently open
# inventory, the Shopkeepers plugin verifies that the open inventory still
# matches the expected type of inventory before it handles inventory
# interactions. This setting disables this verification.
# It is usually recommended keeping this verification enabled. However, when
# the Shopkeepers plugin is used on certain types of modded servers (such as
# variants of Cauldron and its successors), a known issue is that these types
# of servers sometimes report that the currently open inventory is of a type
# different to what it actually is. The result of this verification is then
# that for example the trading inventory is closed when a player tries to
# trade.
# Even though modded servers are not officially supported and may break the
# plugin in various other unexpected ways, disabling the inventory verification
# via this setting may help resolve this particular known incompatibility.

# The number of Minecraft ticks between behavior updates of shopkeeper mobs.
# This controls the rate at which we update the gravity and AI of shopkeeper

# smooth, less reactive, and possibly slower behavior in comparison to the
# behavior of mobs in vanilla Minecraft.
# In order to compensate for a reduced tick rate some activities may be scaled
# accordingly. This ensures, for example, that mobs still rotate their head at
# the same speed towards nearby players, or that mobs still fall at the same
# speed when being affected by gravity.
# Consequently, a reduced tick rate is less performance-intensive in total, but

# However, be aware that this can result in additional unintentional behaviors to be triggered as

# Trade Log
# *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*

# Players can trigger many equal trades in quick succession. For example, when
# players trade by shift clicking the result slot, they can trigger up to 64
# individual trades at once with a single click. And even when not shift
# clicking, they can quickly trigger a considerable number of trades.
# In order to represent the logged trades more compactly, we merge successive
# trades that happen over a certain period of time if they involve the same
# player, the same shopkeeper, and the same items. This setting specifies the
# maximum duration in ticks during which successive equal trades are merged.
# Setting this to a value of 0 disables the merging of trades. Setting this to
# a value of 1 will only merge trades that are triggered by the same inventory
# action (e.g. by the same shift click).
# It is recommended to not set this value to something longer than a few
# seconds: The longer the chosen duration, the greater the difference between
# the logged timestamps and shopkeeper states may be to the actual timestamps
# and shopkeeper states at which the merged trades took place.
trade-log-merge-duration-ticks: 300
# The merging of trades is aborted prematurely if the time gap to the previous
# trade is longer than this duration in ticks. This setting can be used in
# combination with a larger value for 'trade-log-merge-duration-ticks' to limit
# the maximum waiting time for a subsequent trade.
# Setting this to a value of 0, or a value greater than or equal to
# 'trade-log-merge-duration-ticks' will cause this setting to have no effect.
# Setting this to something too low for trades to realistically be manually
# triggered (such as only a few ticks) will make the chosen
# 'trade-log-merge-duration-ticks' effectively pointless. For performance
# reasons, the actual duration may dynamically vary by several ticks.
