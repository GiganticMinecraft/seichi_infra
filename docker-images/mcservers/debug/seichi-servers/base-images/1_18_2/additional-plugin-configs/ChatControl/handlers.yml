# This file support creating custom handlers that

# ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# The purpose of handlers is to group actions when message
# is caught by a rule. This not only saves a bunch of repetitive
# code but makes it more fail proof and future proof.
#
# Unicode characters are supported! Save the file in UTF-8
# encoding. Tested on Notepad++
# [NOTICE] WordPad/Notepad on Windows are known to not work!
