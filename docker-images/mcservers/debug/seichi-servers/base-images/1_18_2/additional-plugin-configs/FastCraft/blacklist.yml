# This file is used to determine what recipes appear in the FastCraft interface.
#
# use-as-whitelist:     By default, this file will tell FastCraft what items to
#                       not show in its interface. If use-as-whitelist is set to
#                       true, then nothing will show up in the interface, unless
#                       it is listed in this file.
#
#
# hashes:               This section can be used to disable specific recipes. each
#                       recipe in the FastCraft interface is associated with a
#                       hash code, which is what you will use to reference the
#                       recipe. To see a recipe's hashcode, open the FastCraft
#                       interface with the command "/fc craft fastcraft*". A
#                       recipe's hashcode will be under its list of ingredients.
#
#
# results/ingredients:  Specific items can be listed here. Items should be listed
#                       using this format: [type, data, metadata]
#
#                       Both data and metadata are optional, but type is required.
#                       Type can be the name of any item, such as 'minecraft:gold'.
#                       If data or metadata are left out, items with any type or
#                       metadata will be matched.
#
#                       For data, either a number can be listed, or ANY if all
#                       item data should be matched.
#
#                       If the metadata is not stated, then items with any metadata
#                       will be matched. If items with no metadata should be matched,
#                       then '{}' can be used.
