# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the implementation of ChatControl's rule engine codenamed ChatCeaser
#
# It accepts following operators (The <> is the parameter you'll specify)
# match <regex> (A valid regular expression to match player's message.)
# id <number/string> (Assign an id/name to the rule. Used in messages and handlers.)
# ignore string <string/regex> (If the message matches the given string it will be ignored.)
# ignore event <chat/commands/signs> (If the rule triggers on specified event it will be ignored.)
# ignore perm <permission> (A permission to bypass the rule.)
# ignore gamemode <survival/creative/adventure/spectator/0/1/2/3> (Gamemodes to be ignored. Separate by | to add multiple values.)
# before strip <regex> (A regular expression used to strip specified characters before the message is checked.)
# before replace <regex> with <message> (A regular expression to replace characters with other characters before the message check.)
# then replace <replacement|replacement2> (A string that replaces only the part of the checked message that matches the match.)
#                                         (Chosen randomly from the messages divided by |)
# then rewrite <message|message2> (A message that replaces the entire checked message.)
#                                         (Chosen randomly from the messages divided by |)
# then deny (Cancel the player's message from appearing. See settinsg.yml for configuration on specific events.)
# then console <command|command2|command3> (Commands to execute as the console. Use %player to get player's name. Split multiple commands by |)
# then warn <message> (A message sent to the player.)
# then kick <optionalResaon> (Kick the player with an optional message.)
# then notify <permission> <message> (Send a message to all players with the permission.)
# then fine <amount> (If Vault is installed - take specified amount of money from the player.)
# then log (Caught message will be printed in console and saved in logs/rules.txt)
# handle as <handler_name> (Launch actions specified in handlers.yml. NOTICE: This must be as a last operator in the rule!)
#
# Valid variables:
# %player (Player's name. Without prefix and suffix.)
# %world (Player's world.)
#
# Supports color codes with '&' character.
# Accepts unicode characters when saved in UTF-8 encoding (tested on Notepad++).
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IP filter. 
# (Notice the operator strip which removes specified characters BEFORE the message is checked.)

# Predefined swear filters are found below, in courtesy of owenmaple.
# Editing them requires basic knowledge of regular expression language.
# See ChatControl's Wiki on Github for starting help (with pictures).
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All rules can safely be removed (or edited, if you are familiar with regex!)
